            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="firstLetter gray">I</span>'ve worked as the part-time IT intern at MaxLite's California facility for over two years. There, I'm the only on-site IT person, and administer more than 50 computers, printers, network devices, telephones, and conference systems in the office and warehouse.
            </p>
            <p>
                My job consists of assisting employees in other departments, on-site and remote, with any issues they may have with their printers, computers, or any of the software we use, including Microsoft Office, MaxLite programs, TeamViewer, and lighting controls software. In addition, I maintain and troubleshoot the facility's multifunction copiers, routers, NEC telephone system, and Cisco TelePresence conference system.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the sole on-site IT point of contact, I am also in charge of the coordination, acquisition, and installation of new devices. Most recently, I organized the acquisition of a Ricoh copier for the second floor office through talking with MaxLite's Ricoh representative and selecting the best machine for our needs and budget. On a day-to-day basis, I order new devices, components, software, and accessories as they are needed.

            <p>
                <span class="firstLetter gray">F</span>or my final senior design project, two other students in my major and I teamed up to build a system that enables a chess engine to read and manipulate a physical chessboard. In short, we created a robot that can play a real-life chess match with anyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                The system, affectionately known as <b title="Our team's name was JAM and Jelly. The human members were JAM (James, Allan, Mario), so we named our robot counterpart Jelly (hehe get it?)">Jelly</b>, consists of a Raspberry Pi that runs the chess engine and an optical recognition program (both written in C++), and an Arduino to control the robot arm's servo motors. The flow of control is as follows:
            </p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>
                    After the opponent makes a move, the optical recognition program sets out to detect the moved piece.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The opponent's move is passed to the chess engine, which first determines if the move was legal.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            If the move was legal, then the chess engine calculates the system's move, and passes it to the Arduino.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the move was illegal, then the system displays a message to the opponent asking them to move the piece back to its previous place.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
               </li>
               <li>
                   The Arduino processes the move, and converts it to a series of instructions for the arm's servos. The arm then performs the move, and Jelly makes a final check to ensure that the move was made correctly.
               </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Jelly's development was divided into three parts: programming the arm to move and grab chess pieces off the board, developing the program through which Jelly uses a camera mounted over the board to detect board moves, and the chess engine that holds the state of the board and the algorithms for Jelly to calculate moves of its own. I was in charge of the latter, building the board and pieces, programming the rules of chess, and developing the brains of the chess engine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the board, pieces, and rules were created, I was in charge of testing the rules to ensure that Jelly accurately discerned between legal and illegal moves in all situations. Most of the bugs were fixed about halfway through the project, but more obscure situations plagued my tests throughout development, specifically with the king and getting in and out of check.
            </p>
            <p>
                After rule testing was complete, I began to build the chess engine. I could've modified an existing chess engine to be compatible with my partners' interfaces, but I felt like I could build a decent chess engine on my own. I researched existing chess engines, as well as chess-playing techniques, before beginning to code Jelly's engine. Because of the Raspberry Pi's memory constraints, I decided to make the engine look only three <b title="A ply, or half-move, occurs when a single player moves a piece. After both players have moved a piece, a move, or full move, has occurred.">plies</b> ahead to decide the best move. However, even then, the tree structure I had constructed resulted in tens of millions of possibilities as the game went on, and Jelly would eventually crash. To correct this, I implemented the alpha-beta pruning algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning" target="_blank">Alpha-beta pruning</a> works by eliminating branches of moves that would result in moves that are either poorer than those in other branches, or have been found in other branches. Implementing this function yielded great results, reducing the move tree's memory requirements by 90%; Jelly no longer crashed! In the end, my chess engine was operational; it showed that it could capture enemy pieces and eventually put the opponent in checkmate. It could have done with more work, however, since it wasn't as aggressive as I hoped it would be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building Jelly's chess engine taught me much on the need to optimize code to reduce space and computational footprints. Jelly had to be both operational and responsive, especially on the low-power Raspberry Pi it was running on. To that effect, I had to reduce the number of plies that the engine looked ahead to so that the program wouldn't take too long to run, and prune the resulting tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was exciting to be able to work with my teammates to put this together in the end and play with the robotic partner we created. Maybe one day, we'll make Jelly a must-have item for anyone looking for a worthy opponent!
