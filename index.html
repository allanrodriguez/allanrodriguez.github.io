                My name is Allan Rodríguez, and I'm 22 years old as of late 2017. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from UC Irvine in June of 2017, and ever since, I've been using my skills to work on small personal projects, and to learn more outside of what school has taught me. I've lived near LA my whole life (626 represent), and love all the opportunities, experiences, and personality that my community has to offer.

                The main reason I made this website is to <span class="linethrough gray">show off how good I am at front-end developing</span> develop the skills I've learned in school and simultaneously promote myself to those who want to know more about me. Although my education focused more on software development, we touched on some web development, which I chose to learn more about outside of a classroom setting and showcase here.

                This site is still under construction, and I plan to add some projects, achievements, and subjectively better pictures of me below. In the meantime, please enjoy the rest of this site, and thank you for visiting!
